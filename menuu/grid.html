              She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no
              desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's
              resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier
              to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep
              insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here

            Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew
            it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in
            the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there
            was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it.
            Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a
            sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic.

            Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was
            being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone yearning to
            just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal.
            He knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to be
            enough.
